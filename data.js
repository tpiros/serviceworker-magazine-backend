      photo: 'img/neymar.jpg',
      content: 'Neymar scored twice as Brazil turned on the style to beat Turkey 4-0 in a friendly in Istanbul. Turkey, who paid around $5m (£3.1m) to entice Dunga\'s side to Istanbul, were no match for a Brazil side unrecognisable from the team that was humiliated 7-1 by Germany in the World Cup semi-final this summer. That is no small part due to new manager Dunga, who has now overseen five wins from five matches since he took over in July. Neymar gave Brazil the lead on 20 minutes before Semir Kaya put through his own goal four minutes later. Chelsea midfielder Willian, one of three Blues\' stars in Dunga\'s starting eleven, then drilled home a third just before half-time after a mazy run down the left from Neymar. Barcelona star Neymar completed the scoring on the hour with his 42nd international goal. Turkey, bottom of Group A with just a point from their three matches, now face Kazakhstan in Istanbul in Euro 2016 qualifying on Sunday.'

      headline: 'Rudi Garcia has defended Ashley Cole in the wake of criticism of the Englishman’s form for Roma this season.',
      photo: 'img/cole.jpg',
      content:'The former Chelsea left-back was substituted at half-time during the Giallorossi’s defeat to Bayern Munich. From this has come speculation in recent days linking Roma with moves for replacement players, with a possible MLS move being mooted for Cole. Despite a shaky start to life in the Italian capital, the 33-year-old can count on his Coach’s backing. "The defeat against Bayern wasn’t just down to one player," Garcia told assembled journalists ahead of Roma’s midweek match with Cesena. "Everyone got things wrong", the Coach included. "Ashley has also had big games where he’s played well, such as the game with Manchester City not long ago [a 1-1 draw at the Etihad]. "He’s feeling good, he’s always positive and he’s a great champion, he’ll be involved in the upcoming games." After the weekend’s draw with Sampdoria, Roma have now managed only one win from their last five games in all competitions, but Garcia is not worried. "One of those five came against Juve, so that doesn’t count," Garcia declared, referencing the fact that Juventus were awarded two penalties in the game, which Roma felt were outside the box. "Even without that, we didn’t lose to City or Sampdoria."'

      photo: 'img/djokovic.jpg',
      content: 'The Serb responded to losing the first two games to steamroller the Swiss who was unfortunate to meet the defending champion at his imperious best. Djokovic tops Group A with two wins and is now poised to qualify for the semi-finals. Djokovic, who will clinch the year-end number one ranking should he beat Tomas Berdych in his final round-robin match, dialled in his A game to counter an aggressive start by Australian Open champion Wawrinka, winning 20 of 23 points in a five-game burst from 0-2 down in the first set. Poor Wawrinka, a semi-finalist here last year, was run ragged at times by the power, precision and finesse of the 27-year-old Djokovic who racked up a 29th consecutive indoor victory with laser-guided forehand winner.'

The 25-year-old had been out of action for six weeks due to a thigh strain he picked up on international duty in early September. He had been thought to be close to a comeback but pulled his calf during training in mid-October forcing him to miss to another month. His return to fitness comes to late to be part of England\'s Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia.'

      headline: 'Morocco, which last week declined to host the African Nations Cup in January because of fears over Ebola, will host the Club World Cup next month as planned, soccer\'s governing body FIFA said on Thursday.',

      content: '"The #ClubWC 2014 will take place in Morocco and all preparations continue as planned", FIFA said on Twitter. The tournament, which also took place in Morocco last year, is held annually and features the champion clubs of each continent. Real Madrid (Europe), San Lorenzo (South America), Western Sydney Wanderers (Asia), Auckland City (Oceania), Cruz Azul (CONCACAF) and Entente Seitif (Africa) will take part, plus Moghreb Athletic, who qualified as champions of hosts Morocco. Morocco pulled out of hosting the Nations Cup because it believes thousands of travelling supporters from west Africa pose a risk and wanted a postponement of at least six months while the fight against Ebola intensified. The virus has killed at least 4,950 people in the world\'s worst Ebola epidemic since the disease was identified in 1976. Morocco had asked for a postponement of the Nations Cup but CAF said the tournament must go ahead in January and February as scheduled, and said it would name a new host in the next few days.'
